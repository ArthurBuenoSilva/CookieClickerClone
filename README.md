# Cookie Clicker Clone

I decided to develop this project to improve my programming and logic skills.

This project is a clone I am developing of the Cookie Clicker game that is very famous on the internet. I'm trying to make all the features as close as possible.

Right now I have the following features working:
<ul>
  <li>Base algorithm</li>
  <li>Shop system</li>
  <li>Upgrade system</li>
  <li>Nuber format</li>
</ul>

Basically I have a fully functional game that just needs some finishing touches.

So far the biggest challenge was to think of a good solution to fix and balance the upgrade system, it was a lot of work but finally I have a fully functional and very well optimized upgrade system.
